Eyecraft

## üìö Project Overview

as its my first fullstack project that i build the entire my own ,it will only be a crud application and no authentications and payments or etc.. features are added . it is a simple repository that anyone can follow to get the hang of how we do make fullstack app with MERN + zustand for state management.
"btw zustand is great..."

### Key Features

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Express.js for handling server-side logic and API routes.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing product data, with Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library.

## üöÄ Getting Started
after downloading or cloning this repo;
run following commands in the terminal of your code editor(make sure you opened the folder in your editor btw..)

npm run build

npm run start

after this you can go to the browser and type localhost:5000
this is the port no declared in the .env file and also the mongouri is also there so make sure to create this .env and put PORT = 5000 and MONGO_URI = "your_mongodb_connection string"

your_mongodb_connection string you have to mention your mongo uri here not the exact text ....

i guess thats all ... happy coding .....
